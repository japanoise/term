# Tabbed ST install

Quick installation for the st terminal emulator and tabbed utility, which also
installs a quick-and-dirty `.desktop` file. I'm using my patched versions in
this repository, but the script is agnostic and should work with other people's
versions; you can build a fork by changing where the submodules point to.
